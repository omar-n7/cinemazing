This website is designed as an IMDb clone using React, and TMDB API service. I created this project to get acclimated with using ReactJS
and the structural benefits of the framework. This initial commit doesn't have much documentation because I didn't get a chance to add all
the functionality I wanted (such as adding a TV Shows section) and so the code may not look as professional as some may hope.
Either way, thank you for taking the time to read this!
